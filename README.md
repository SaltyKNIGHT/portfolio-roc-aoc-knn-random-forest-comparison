# Comparing AUC-ROC KNN and Random Forest
The purpose for this research is to compare these 2 algorithm through this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

Requirement to run the code:
1. NumPy -> ``` pip install numpy```
2. seaborn -> ```pip install seaborn```
3. Pandas -> ```pip install pandas```
4. scikit-learn -> ```pip install -U scikit-learn```
5. Jupyter Notebook -> ```pip install notebook```
6. python-math -> ```pip install python-math```

If for some reason there is still error the problem maybe on the library, unnecessary library can be deleted in order to run the code properly.
